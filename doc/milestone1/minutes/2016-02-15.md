##Mon. Feb 15th, 2016 -- Meeting with Ethan, Leo, and Hardik##


#### What we did:
	* Discussed strings and comments --> tried to simplify/fix our scanner
	* Changed some of the string literal scanning
	* Moved on to CFG
	* Hardik did expressions
	* Leo & Ethan did prog, pack_dec, top_dec, fnc_dec, args, args_of_type, id_list


#### To ask TA (tomorrow after class):
	* What's the proper way to define the tokens for Rune, Raw String, and Interpreted String (and multiline comments)?
	* Mismatches between right and left of single line multivariable declaration --> handle with type-checker or parser?

#### Next meeting:
	* Tomorrow 12:30-3:30pm --> meet with TA, grab lunch, and TRY to finish grammar
