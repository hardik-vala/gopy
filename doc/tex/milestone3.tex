\section{Introduction}

We decided to generate Python. At this point, we feel we have completed most of the code generator, despite deciding to re-implement our type checking system. 

\section{Implementation Complete}
\begin{itemize}
\item All literals except rune
\begin{itemize}
\item We haven't decided how to handle the discrepancy between char and int representations of runes in python
\end{itemize}
\item Operators including increment/decrement, unary, and binary
\item Print and println
\item Loops including while, for
\item Switch statements
\item Op assign
\item Function declarations
\item Function call expressions
\item Continue and break
\item Return
\item Assignment statements
\item Short declarations
\end{itemize}

\section{Implementation in Progress:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Array, field, append, typecasting
\item Struct, distributed var dec, if else
\item Scoping rules have some problems (e.g. variable naming conventions since python has different scoping rules)
\item We still have a lot of "pass" keywords in our generated code to handle empty blocks
\item In python, ints aren't 32 bit so when translating go into python we need to add a bit wrap around to force the overflow
\end{itemize}
