####Weeding:####

  * Checking for string casts, checking that expressions in simple_stmt are valid (e.g., function calls)
  * Mismatching numbers of ids and values in declaration statements
  * Check that left-hand side expression lists only include valid left hand tokens (also check this for ++ and --)
  * Distinguishing between function calls and custom type casts
  * Constrain package declaration to main and check to make sure one main function exists in each file
  * Define our own exception class
  * Reasonable exceptions with line numbers
  * Only one default case in switch statements
