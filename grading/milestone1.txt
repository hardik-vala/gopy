Q1
══

  • Total: 9/10
    • All three programs are syntactically valid
    • prime_count and sort_search compute something useful, however the
      solution to Project Euler #1 is of dubious utility; a more
      challenging problems (e.g. 10 or 31 ) would've been more
      interesting. (-1)


Q2
══

  • Total: 26.9/30
    • Valid programs: 14.1/16
      • Recognized as valid: 237/269
      • Recognized as invalid: 32/269
    • Invalid programs: 8.8/10
      • Recognized as invalid: 334/378
    • Good error messages: 4/4
      • Error messages contain position information (line and column)
      • Error messages contain information on the nature of the error


Q3
══

  • Total: 10/10
    • Good details on the contributions of each team member
    • Would've liked to read about tricky parsing rules (e.g. making
      sure assignment and short declarations don't have a conflict)

  • For the invalid programs, I did a quick "weeding" pass of my own: I
    removed tests that contained the string "weed", "blank", "continue"
    and "break".
